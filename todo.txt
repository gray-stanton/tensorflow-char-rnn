Todo:
    Rewrite CLI/model to accept/use YAML config files as shared state for model properties
    Alter running code just a bit so that it can work for any discrete state seq-to-seq problem
    Write evaluate code that generates sequences and evaluates state freq compared to 
        source state freq, also want a measure of novelty of generated sequences, to tell
        if the model is just reproducing existing sequences
        May also want to evaluate bigram/trigram frequency in addition to single char
    Alter modelling code to take argument if should be executed on GPU
    Check to see if my python generator function thing is taking up a lot of time
        may need to switch to QueueRunner
    Finish up generated section so it doesnt do that thing
